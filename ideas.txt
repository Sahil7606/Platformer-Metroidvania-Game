Put ideas here:


Combat System:
    Defending:
        Player walks slower when sheilding
        When blocking enemy attacks, player must time shield correctly
        Worse the timing, the more damage taken
        If your timing is perfect, then you perform a parry and the enemy gets staggered
        
    Attacking:
        Player can do a lunge attack, a regular attack, and a charged attack
        Different weapons are better at certain attacks than others
        Weapon classes include: swords, spears, axes
        Swords are better at regular attacks, spears are good with lunge attacks, and axes are good for charged attacks
        1.5x damage is done when enemies are staggered
